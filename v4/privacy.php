<h3 id="section3">3. Sharing of Personal Information</h3>
<p>We may share your personal information with the following categories of third parties:</p>

<ol class="letters">
    <li><strong>Our affiliates.</strong> We may share personal information with our affiliates to provide our Sites and
        Services and for internal administrative purposes.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Product/Service providers.</strong> We share personal information with our product/service providers,
        such as analytics, advertising, marketing, customer and technical support, and other services. These third
        parties have access to your personal information only to perform these tasks and are obligated not to disclose
        or use the information for any other purpose.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Third-Parties.</strong> We share personal information, either directly or through intermediary agents
        and/or entities (including, lead aggregators and vendors to such businesses), with one or more third-party
        entities, such as solar and/or home improvement product/service providers, marketers of such products/services,
        and/or affiliate companies (collectively, including intermediaries, “Third-Parties”). For example, we may share
        personal information with Third-Parties for their direct marketing purposes. We may also share personal
        information with Third-Parties at a point in time after it is initially collected.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Promotions Providers.</strong> In addition to Third-Parties, our Sites may also present offers for
        promotions for other products and services that may be of interest to you (“Promotions Providers”). We only
        share limited web tracking data with Promotions Providers if you choose to click on the hyperlinks we provide
        for their offers, which will take you to the Promotions Provider’s website.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Third-party platform advertising.</strong> We may share your information with third-party platform
        providers who assist us in serving advertising regarding the Sites and Services to others who may be interested.
        We also partner with third parties (such as Facebook and Google) who use Cookies to serve interest-based
        advertising and content on their respective third-party platforms that may be based on your preferences,
        location and/or interests.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Affiliate and business transfer.</strong> If Lead Flux is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset
        sale, your personal information may be transferred. We will provide notice before your personal information is
        transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Compliance and harm prevention.</strong> We may share personal information as we believe necessary (i)
        to comply with applicable law, rules and regulations; (ii) to enforce our contractual rights; (iii) to

        privacy, safety and property of Lead Flux, you or others; and (v) to respond to requests from courts, law
        enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies, and other public and government authorities.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>The selection of a Third-Party to acquire your personal information may be determined by a comparison with available
    products/services, including solar and/or home improvement-related products/services. The position of each potential
    purchaser may also be determined primarily by the price the purchaser is willing to pay for the information (e.g.,
    the higher the price, the better the purchaser's position).</p>
<p>We may create aggregated, anonymous or de-identified data from personal information by removing data components that
    make the data personally identifiable to you or through obfuscation or other means. Our use of aggregated,
    anonymized and de-identified data is not subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>You may have rights and choices regarding our use and disclosure of your personal information. Unless instructed
    otherwise, you can exercise these rights and choices using the information in the <a href="#section11">Contact Us</a> section at the end of
    this Policy.</p>
<ol>

        request.

                        to collect and record your activities and movements across our websites throughout your browsing
                        session, consistent with your notice and consent, for purposes of our own internal analytics and
                        improving our products, services, and user experience. We describe how your information is shared

                    We are a marketing lead generator/advertising referral service. We do not charge you a fee.
                    We possess a material financial connection to Third-Parties in that we are compensated for
                    each purchased lead. We are not a solar and/or home improvement product/service provider,
                    or a representative thereof. We do not provide price quotes. Quotes are provided by third-party
                    product/service providers. We are not affiliated with or endorsed by the U.S. government or
                    any federal program. We do not control/are not responsible for the actions of Third-Parties.

                    Third-Parties have the option to purchase a given lead from us. There is no guarantee that
                    you will be accepted by a Third-Party. Your information may be sold and re-sold multiple
                    times leading to multiple offers from solar and/or home improvement product/service providers.
                    You may be contacted multiple times by numerous Third-Parties for products/services.
                    <strong style="font-weight: bold;">The selection of a Third-Party to acquire your information may be determined primarily
                        by the price the purchaser is willing to pay for the information (e.g., the higher the
                        price, the better the purchaser’s position) and/or a comparison thereof with available
                        products/services, including solar and/or home improvement-related products/services.

                    Following submission of your information, you may be redirected to the website of a
                    Third-Party. Carefully consider that Third-Parties may retain or use your information even
                    if you do not use their products/services. Contact Third-Parties directly concerning their
                    privacy policies, which may differ from our Privacy Policy. If you have any questions or wish
                    to remove your information from a Third-Party’s database, you need to contact that Third-Party
                    directly. Each Third-Party has their own terms, conditions and policies and we do not have
